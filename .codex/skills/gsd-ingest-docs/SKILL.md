## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$gsd-ingest-docs`.
- Treat all user text after `$gsd-ingest-docs` as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. AskUserQuestion → request_user_input Mapping
GSD workflows use `AskUserQuestion` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex `request_user_input`:

Parameter mapping:
- `header` → `header`
- `question` → `question`
- Options formatted as `"Label" — description` → `{label: "Label", description: "description"}`
- Generate `id` from header: lowercase, replace spaces with underscores

Batched calls:
- `AskUserQuestion([q1, q2])` → single `request_user_input` with multiple entries in `questions[]`

Multi-select workaround:
- Codex has no `multiSelect`. Use sequential single-selects, or present a numbered freeform list asking the user to enter comma-separated numbers.

Execute mode fallback:
- When `request_user_input` is rejected or unavailable, you MUST stop and present the questions as a plain-text numbered list, then wait for the user's reply. Do NOT pick a default and continue (#3018).
- You may only proceed without a user answer when one of these is true:
  (a) the invocation included an explicit non-interactive flag (`--auto` or `--all`),
  (b) the user has explicitly approved a specific default for this question, or
  (c) the workflow's documented contract says defaults are safe (e.g. autonomous lifecycle paths).
- Do NOT write workflow artifacts (CONTEXT.md, DISCUSSION-LOG.md, PLAN.md, checkpoint files) until the user has answered the plain-text questions or one of (a)-(c) above applies. Surfacing the questions and waiting is the correct response — silently defaulting and writing artifacts is the #3018 failure mode.

## C. Task() → spawn_agent Mapping
GSD workflows use `Task(...)` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex collaboration tools:

Direct mapping:
- `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` → `spawn_agent(agent_type="X", message="Y")`
- `Task(model="...")` → omit. `spawn_agent` has no inline `model` parameter;
  GSD embeds the resolved per-agent model directly into each agent's `.toml`
  at install time so `model_overrides` from `.planning/config.json` and
  `~/.gsd/defaults.json` are honored automatically by Codex's agent router.
- Resolved `reasoning_effort="low|medium|high|xhigh"` (`xhigh` is a GSD/Codex tier, not a generic runtime enum) → pass `reasoning_effort`
  to `spawn_agent` when the runtime/tool supports it. Omit missing, empty,
  inherited, or unsupported values; do not invent one-off effort literals in
  workflow prose.
- `fork_context: false` by default — GSD agents load their own context via `<files_to_read>` blocks
- `Task(isolation="worktree")` / `Agent(isolation="worktree")` → no direct Codex mapping.
  Codex `spawn_agent` does not create or bind a git worktree automatically.
  Workflows that require this isolation must fail closed or use an explicit
  manual worktree protocol before spawning (#3360).

Spawn restriction:
- Codex restricts `spawn_agent` to cases where the user has explicitly
  requested sub-agents. When automatic spawning is not permitted, do the
  work inline in the current agent rather than attempting to force a spawn.

Parallel fan-out:
- Spawn multiple agents → collect agent IDs → `wait(ids)` for all to complete

Result parsing:
- Look for structured markers in agent output: `CHECKPOINT`, `PLAN COMPLETE`, `SUMMARY`, etc.
- `close_agent(id)` after collecting results from each agent

<objective>
Build the full `.planning/` setup (or merge into an existing one) from multiple pre-existing planning documents — ADRs, PRDs, SPECs, DOCs — in one pass.

- **Net-new bootstrap** (`--mode new`, default when `.planning/` is absent): produces PROJECT.md + REQUIREMENTS.md + ROADMAP.md + STATE.md from synthesized doc content, delegating final generation to `gsd-roadmapper`.
- **Merge into existing** (`--mode merge`, default when `.planning/` is present): appends phases and requirements derived from the ingested docs; hard-blocks any contradiction with existing locked decisions.

Auto-synthesizes most conflicts using the precedence rule `ADR > SPEC > PRD > DOC` (overridable via manifest). Surfaces unresolved cases in `.planning/INGEST-CONFLICTS.md` with three buckets: auto-resolved, competing-variants, unresolved-blockers. The BLOCKER gate from the shared conflict engine prevents any destination file from being written when unresolved contradictions exist.

**Inputs:** directory-convention discovery (`docs/adr/`, `docs/prd/`, `docs/specs/`, `docs/rfc/`, root-level `{ADR,PRD,SPEC,RFC}-*.md`), or an explicit `--manifest <file>` YAML listing `{path, type, precedence?}` per doc.

**v1 constraints:** hard cap of 50 docs per invocation; `--resolve interactive` is reserved for a future release.
